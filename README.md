# What Is The Protector?

The Protector is an upcoming open-source bot designed for A Township Tale (ATT) using the [TownSharp library](https://github.com/PolyphonyRequiem/Townsharp). It aims to be a powerful and versatile tool that will eventually be available for the broader ATT community, empowering server administrators with enhanced management capabilities.

# Why Are You Making This Bot?

The development of The Protector began as a side project for my friend's server, [Village RP](https://tavern.townshiptale.com/servers/661848510). Originally intended as a private tool, I soon realized its potential value to the entire ATT community. This inspired me to open-source the project, making it accessible to everyone. During its early stages of development, access will be limited to select servers to ensure stability and gather feedback before the full release.

# About The Protector

The Protector is poised to be the first open-source ATT bot, as far as I’m aware, featuring built-in Discord integration to bridge the gap between your game server and your community. The bot will be primarily written in C#, ensuring efficient performance and maintainability. While the Discord integration may initially involve non-C# components, the goal is to keep as much of the codebase in C# as possible.

Future updates may introduce advanced features like voice command support, but the initial release will focus on core functionality and stability. As development progresses, I’m committed to making The Protector a robust tool for server management and community engagement.
