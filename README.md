# What Is The Protector

The Protector is a Soon To Be Fully Open Source ATT Bot Using [TownSharp](https://github.com/PolyphonyRequiem/Townsharp).




# Why Are You Making This Bot

This Bot Was originally Going To Be A Side Project For My Fiends Server Called [Village RP](https://tavern.townshiptale.com/servers/661848510).
But I Wanted To Make The Bot Public So That Is What I Will Be Doing. When The Bot Is In Its Ealy Stages Of Develpoment Only Certain Server Will Have access.
