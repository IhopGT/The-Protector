# What Is The Protector?
The Protector is an ambitious, upcoming open-source bot tailored for A Township Tale (ATT), built on the powerful [TownSharp framework](https://github.com/PolyphonyRequiem/Townsharp). This bot is designed to revolutionize server management within the ATT community by providing a suite of advanced features and integrations. The Protector will be a game-changing tool, offering server administrators enhanced control and functionality to better manage their gaming environments and foster vibrant, engaged communities.

# Why Are You Making This Bot?
The journey of creating The Protector began with a personal initiative to address specific needs within my friend's server, [Village RP](https://tavern.townshiptale.com/servers/661848510). Initially, The Protector was conceived as a side project intended to optimize server operations and elevate the user experience for that particular community. However, it quickly became evident that the potential benefits of this bot extended far beyond a single server.

Driven by the desire to make a broader impact, I decided to transition The Protector from a private tool to an open-source project. This decision reflects my commitment to enhancing the ATT community as a whole, by making the bot's features and innovations accessible to server administrators everywhere. In the early stages of development, access will be restricted to a select group of servers. This controlled rollout will allow for rigorous testing and feedback collection, ensuring that the bot’s functionalities are refined and robust before a wider release.

# About The Protector
The Protector is set to be a trailblazer in the ATT ecosystem, representing the first open-source ATT bot with built-in Discord integration. This integration is designed to seamlessly connect game server management with community interaction, facilitating real-time communication and streamlined administrative tasks.

The bot will be developed primarily in C#, leveraging the language’s efficiency and performance benefits to deliver a high-quality experience. While the majority of The Protector’s codebase will be written in C#, certain aspects, particularly those related to Discord integration, may involve other technologies. The goal is to maintain a consistent and high-performing core while exploring the best tools and methods for achieving seamless integration with Discord.

Looking ahead, there are plans to introduce additional features, including voice command support, to further enhance The Protector’s capabilities. These advancements will be implemented in future updates, with the initial release focusing on delivering core functionalities and ensuring a stable, reliable performance. My ongoing commitment is to continually develop and improve The Protector based on user feedback and emerging needs within the ATT community.

By making The Protector open-source, I aim to foster a collaborative environment where server administrators and developers can contribute to its growth and evolution. The project is not just about creating a tool but about building a community of users who can help shape its future and maximize its potential.
